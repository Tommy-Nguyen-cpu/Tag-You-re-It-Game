# Tag-You-re-It-Game
Created a game in Java where the player has to run away from monsters and reach the exit (the yellow rectangle).
Took approximately 5-6 months to complete (as a result of multitasking this project and school work). Normally, this project would take a month or so.

1. There is a shop where you are able to buy items and use them. However, these items can only be used during a specific stage (before reaching an exit).
2. There is an option window where the user can adjust the volume of the music.
3. The mobs will try to follow the main character (but it is just adjusting the distance, but looking for a path).

This was the first time I tried making a game, so the code is messy. I plan on creating something similar in the future.
